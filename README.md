# RC_Plane

## Why am I doing this
I received a project to send something into the sky and then retreive it safely for data. I think that the most fun way to do this project is to make a working RC plane to fly.
## How?
I need to hook up a propeller to a DC motor and two servos to the wings in order to make the plane fly and retreive the flight data.
## What do I need?
